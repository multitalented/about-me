          <h3>Composer</h3>
          <p>
            Long before I even knew what engineering meant, I thought I was
            going to be a composer! Ever since I laid my eyes and my little
            fingers on a keyboard (a toy one to begin with), I was fascinated.
            My parents told me that I was making my little yellow toy keyboard
            sound good making up my own songs when I was about 4 years old.
            Eventually I got a light-up Casio keyboard and starting teaching
            myself songs with the song bank, but I begged for lessons. Coming
            from poor and uneducated families, they weren’t the most excited
            about buying a piano and paying for lessons. Luckily I found a great
            teacher who doted on me for a few years, teaching me how to harness
            my songwriting and improvise. When I was 15 and moved 1000 miles
            away with my family, I lost my teacher, and this likely had a huge
            influence on my losing this direction, as my parents were not as
            supportive. Fortunately, I never stopped playing or writing, I just
            stopped putting myself out there for a long time, keeping my music
            private.

          <h3>Engineer</h3>
          <p class="computergirl-skill-description">
            I ended up going to school for engineering because like many out
            there, I chose to do what others thought I should do. This
            contributed to some major depression for a good while, but there was
            still many positives that came out of this path. After my first
            couple years as an engineer in the workforce, I realized I needed to
            figure out what I wanted from working because I was not fulfilled.
            Eventually I obtained a masters in engineering from Georgia
            Institute of Technology, where I furthered my knowledge in
            acoustics, signals, optimization, and advanced programming. These
            skills helped me appreciate music even more and made me see a love I
            had at the intersection of engineering and music. If I had known
            about the field of audio engineering, I probably would’ve studied
            that, but instead I teach myself what I need to know as I develop my
            recording studio!

          <h3>Creative Writer</h3>
          <p>
            I always loved writing in just about any capacity. Growing up I
            wrote a lot of poems, short stories, and essays. I would always try
            to slip in some cheek, even into grad school, when I spent hours
            pouring over MATLAB code for a project. Slipping humor into my
            reports always helped me get me through the gruel of technical
            writing and was usually appreciated by the graders. These days, I
            tend to enjoy writing parody/satire, usually as a gift for someone
            or simply inspired by my day to day life at work.

          <h3>Gamer</h3>
          <p>
            Very closely tied to my love for music, writing stories, and coding,
            growing up on video games is where it all began. I watched my
            brother play Mega Man and Mario games, mesmerized by the music and
            action. My love for video games only increased as I got older and
            moved from classic consoles to PC and modern gaming. I absolutely
            credit those early days as having a strong influence on my
            songwriting style.

          <h3>Language Learner</h3>
          <p class="language-skill-description">
            I know, is this really relevant? “Deanna, everyone does Duolingo”,
            you may say, rolling your eyes. No, I don’t actually use Duolingo. I
            use a host of other tools, books, and methods to immerse myself in a
            language I want to learn. My passion for languages started when I
            was at a major low point in my life at the age of 25 and realized I
            was making major life decisions based on what someone else thought I
            should do. I felt like I had missed some real opportunities and not
            explored myself more. At that point, I delved deep into a number of
            things, including French, reading classic literature, tennis, web
            development. Eventually when I did my masters at Georgia Tech, I
            decided to do some of it at their campus in Metz, France, where I
            got to put my French into practice! Since then, I’ve been focused on
            Spanish and Russian. One of my favorite parts of learning a language
            is learning the culture and nuance. I love seeing the patterns in a
            language and learning how to think differently. It’s so neat!
