          <h3>Composer</h3>
          <p>
            I am very much a self-taught composer with almost a lifetime of
            experience doing it. I’ve always naturally been the intuitive
            creative type, and as long as I can remember, I’ve been writing
            music. Ever since I laid my little fingers on a keyboard, I was
            fascinated. My parents tell me that I was making my little toy
            keyboard sound good when I was just a toddler. Eventually I got a
            light-up keyboard and starting teaching myself songs, but I begged
            for lessons. Finally when I was 11, I got a great teacher who
            mentored me for a few years, teaching me how to harness my
            songwriting and improvisational skills. I was donated an upright
            piano by her friend, I would perform at nursing homes and talent
            shows, and I had 3 “albums” recorded at her friend’s home studio. I
            taught myself how to notate and arrange music in a pirated copy of
            Finale. Unfortunately, when I was 15, my family moved 1000 miles
            away, and I lost that encouragement, since my parents were not as
            supportive of this dream. Fortunately, I never stopped playing video
            games or writing music, I just stopped putting myself out there,
            keeping my music private. Ever since doing my first game jam in
            January 2022 though, I’ve decided to put myself back out there!

          <h3>Engineer</h3>
          <p class="computergirl-skill-description">
            I went to school for engineering partly because I was doing what my
            parents thought I should do, but also I convinced myself I didn’t
            need to go to school for music since I had already spent my
            childhood essentially studying it. Since I continued to play piano,
            I never lost sight of staying true to myself. After my first couple
            years as an engineer in the workforce, I realized I needed to figure
            out what I wanted from my career because I did not find meaning in
            my job. Eventually I obtained a masters in engineering where I
            studied acoustics, signals, optimization, and C++, which laid a good
            foundation for audio. I found love at the intersection of
            engineering and music! Now I use my technical background to learn
            audio engineering as needed. I also work as an engineer for the
            government, where I get a lot more meaning from what I do, since I
            realized how important it was for me to have a purpose in what I do.

          <h3>Writer</h3>
          <p>
            I always loved writing in just about any capacity. Although I’ve
            done a LOT of technical writing as an engineer, when I was growing
            up I wrote a lot of poems, short stories, journal entries, and even
            some comics. I’ve always enjoyed finding creative ways to spin
            things with word play, even into grad school, when I spent hours
            pouring over code and results for a project. I would get to the
            final report, and finally feel like I could get away from the
            constraints of fact to the open world of writing. Slipping humor
            into my reports always helped me get me through the gruel of
            technical writing and was often appreciated by graders. These days,
            I like to write in various forms, but my favorite is coming up with
            comics and parody.

          <h3>Gamer</h3>
          <p>
            Very closely tied to my love for music, growing up on video games is
            where it all began. I watched my brother play Mega Man and Mario
            games, mesmerized by the music most of all. My love for video games
            has only increased as I got older and moved from classic consoles to
            PC and modern gaming. I absolutely credit those early days as having
            a strong influence on my songwriting style. Besides MegaMan, my
            favorite games/series include Zelda, Professor Layton, BioShock,
            Portal, Super Meat Boy, Fable, Dishonored, Super Mario, TIS-100, and
            Amnesia.

          <h3>Language Learner</h3>
          <p class="language-skill-description">
            My passion for languages started in my mid 20s, when I realized I
            had not explored myself more in college and delved into French and
            classic literature. Eventually when I did my masters at Georgia
            Tech, I studied at their campus in Metz, France, where I put my
            French into practice. Since then, I’ve used the methods discussed in
            Fluent Forever to learn Spanish and Russian. I love finding the
            patterns in a language and learning how to think differently. It’s
            so neat!

          <h3>Self-taught</h3>
          <p class="language-skill-description">
            I love learning, and I love helping people, so when I learn new
            things, I love sharing about it! My favorite YouTube content is
            educational and I’ve done a number of courses between that, Udemy
            and Pluralsight on various mostly game and tech topics, such as
            Unity, game dev, web dev, SQL, networking (IT), cybersecurity, and
            Wwise. Grad school really furthered my belief that I can teach
            myself anything, so I teach myself what I need to know when I need
            to know it.

          <h3>Art Enthusiast</h3>
          <p class="language-skill-description">
            When I was at the University of Florida, I worked as a figure model 
            for the College of Fine Arts. I loved being close to art by working 
            with students in their figure painting, drawing, and ceramics courses. 
            Some projects required bringing in props and costume pieces to help set 
            up a scene for the students, which I always enjoyed. Now I just appreciate 
            artists so much for what they do. The most art I do is comic stick figures, 
            bad acrylic paintings, and geometrical/mathematical art.

          <h3>Reader</h3>
          <p class="language-skill-description">
            I am always reading something, and I believe in the power of gaining 
            knowledge, inspiration, and empathy through reading others’ stories and 
            perspectives. I’m happy to discuss and share my book recommendations any time!

          <h3>Cat Lover</h3>
          <p class="language-skill-description">
            Most importantly I am a lover of animals, and specifically cats. If you come across my gamer tag FergiesHuman, or more properly, “Fergie’s Human”, 
            it means my cat’s name is Fergie and I am her human. We’ve been in a committed relationship 
            now for 13 years and she is like my little Pokemon. If you don’t love cats, meet mine and you 
            will fall in love. Besides Fergie, I also love pretty much every cat I ever meet, but I am very 
            fond of tortoiseshell and calico coats. </p>
